The image should embody epic portraiture and double exposure, featuring an isolated landscape visible through the window. The colors should primarily be dynamic and action-packed, with a strong use of negative space. The entire artwork should be in pixel art style, emphasizing the characters shape and set against a white background. Silhouette"
